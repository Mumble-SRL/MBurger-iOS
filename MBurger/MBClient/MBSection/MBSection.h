#pragma mark - Object mapping

/**
 *  Copy a set of elements values from this Entry to a custom object. This is very useful if you want to initialize a custom object you created with the values of the elements of this section. The properties of elements can be queried with the dot notation, e.g. image.firstImage.url, if no property is queried the object mapped is the value of the element, for example if it's a MBTextElement it will map the string value.
 *
 *  @param object     The object that will be filled with this data.
 *  @param mapping    A dictionary with the mapping to fill the data of the object.
 *
 *  @return The mapped object mapped.
